# MOFid

A system for rapid identification and analysis of metal-organic frameworks.

Please cite [DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.9b01050](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.9b01050) if you use MOFid in your work.

## Objective

Supplement the current MOF naming conventions with a canonical, machine-readable identifier to facilitate data mining and searches. Accomplish this goal by representing MOFs according to their nodes and linkers and topology.

## Usage and Installation Instructions

There are three main ways in which you can use MOFid.
1. From your browser.
2. By compiling the MOFid source code and running it locally.
3. By using Singularity or Docker to run a pre-built image of the MOFid code locally.

### Browser-based MOFid

Visit [Web MOFid](https://snurr-group.github.io/web-mofid/) to quickly and easily run MOFid in your browser! No programming skills are required.

### Compiling from Source

See TODO for how to compile and run MOFid from source.
